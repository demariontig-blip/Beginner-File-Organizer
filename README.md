PYTHON FILE ORGANIZER!



Organizes a folder of your choice into 5 categories:

Images, Audios, Documents, Videos, Archives, and Others

Handles duplicate filenames and prints a summary as well.


Note: Although all filetypes are supported, some that may belong in the 'Audios' category might be put into the 'Others' category instead.



In order to use the script, you have to do the following:


1. Open File Organizer.py
2. type in the FULL address (EX. C:\\Users\\(yourname)\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Folder)
3. Wait for it to automatically put all the files in the categories depending on the filetype
4. press ENTER to exit after everything is finished.
